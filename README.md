# CDAC-Final_Project
=======
I am currently working on this project titled Drug Distribution Management System,  using languages like Spring boot for backend , reactjs for Frontend and mysql for database . This project is an interaction  between Pharmacist, and devoloper , And in  future scope between Health organization,  Manufacturers and Pharmacists . Which would help in the controlled and monitored flow of drug's , where the HO will be aware of what , where , when and why , this 4 w's of drugs Distribution. This will limit the illegal Distribution of drugs to some extent also will make it possible to pass the medicine to each and every locality in case of emergency,  just like what happened durIng CORONA while many lives were lost dur to in sufficient or unplanned flow of medicines.
